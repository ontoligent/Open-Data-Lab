# Rivanna
Rivanna is the University of Virginia's High-Performance Computing (HPC) system.  Rivanna is open to all faculty, research staff, and graduate students of the University.   All faculty and research staff are eligible for a standard free allocation.  Larger allocations may be requested through the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, or the Data Science Institute.  Allocations may also be purchased.
